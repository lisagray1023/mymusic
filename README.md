# My Music Musical Structure App project
Grow with Google Android Basics Nanodegree - Multi-Screens App section "Musical Structure App" project.

Since images were not required, I used one album cover image as a placeholder on the Now Playing page, in the future album cover art would be added to the Song object and passed through from the MainActivity to the NowPlaying activity. I also used an image to represent where the audio controls would go for layout purposes, since the project does not require any music to play.

The app was tested on an LG G6 running Android 7.0.
